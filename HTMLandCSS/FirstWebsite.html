            <p>I am 25 years of age, living in the UK and currently work in admin. <br> I am looking for a career change and to create multiple streams of income. I have qualifications in different insustries ranging from beauty and cosmetics to health and wellbeing. <br> It is very exciting for me to be taking up this course as it is completely different to what I am used to and I know I will enjoy it as I am always eager to learn new things and integrate them into my career and life. <br> I hope I can utilise this course to navigate my way into the tech industry and create another source of income. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/"target="_blank">Press here </a>
